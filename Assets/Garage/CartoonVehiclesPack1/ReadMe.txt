Both cars have rigged softtop roofs you can open and close.

Alternatively just enable/disable the roof.

There are two versions of this vehicle- one with a side window, and one without.
The one with the window can be used as a food truck, for everything else,
use the other one.

Disable either one. Or throw anything you want on it.
The frame is extendible to fit any sized container.

General tips:

The detailMeshes folder includes an antenna you can put on your cars.
It is rigged to a bone to give it the ability to bend.
For best results, use a jigglebone script on it.
If you're using Unity3D, I had good results with this script
